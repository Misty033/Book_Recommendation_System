# Book Recommendation System

A scalable book recommendation system built using **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering**, capable of handling large datasets and providing personalized book suggestions.

## Features

- **Scalable Recommendation System**: Handles **6 million ratings** and **10,000 books** efficiently.  
- **NLP & Embeddings**: Generates book embeddings using **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** for content-based recommendations.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements **Surprise SVD** for rating predictions.  
- **Ranking & Similarity Search**: Uses **FAISS** for fast nearest-neighbor search in content-based filtering.  
- **Optimized Performance**: Leverages **NumPy** and vectorized operations for high-performance computations.  
- **Data Analysis & Insights**: Explores trends and patterns in user ratings to enhance recommendation quality.
